SCENARIO:

YOUR ORGANIZATION IS AIMING TO AUTOMATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE CREATION AND DEPLOYMENT PROCEDURE. YOU ARE TASKED WITH SETTING UP AND CONFIGURING THE AWS ENVIRONMENT TO MEET SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.

QUESTION:

 CREATE AN INSTANCE IN AWS MANUALLY WHICH WILL BE ACTING AS THE TERRAFORM MASTER MACHINE USING WHICH YOU HAVE TO CREATE A VPC AND A SUBNET IN THAT VPC, YOU WILL THEN HAVE TO CREATE 3 MORE INSTANCES IN THAT SUBNET
ANY CONFIGURATIONS NEEDED TO BE MADE HAS TO BE ACHIEVED USING ANSIBLE, I.E. JENKINS AND KUBERNETES INSTALLATIONS IN THE REQUIRED MACHINES.
ONE OF THE 3 MACHINES CREATED USING TERRAFORM WILL BE BEHAVING AS THE MASTER FOR JENKINS AND THE OTHER WILL BE THE KUBERNETES MASTER MACHINE WHICH WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE ADDED AS A KUBERNETES AGENT IN THE JENKINS DASHBOARD. THE THIRD MACHINE WILL BE FULFILLING THE ROLE OF YOUR KUBERNETES SLAVE NODE WHICH DOES NOT NEED TO BE ADDED AS A JENKINS AGENT.
A DOCKERFILE ALSO NEEDS TO BE CREATED TO CONTAINERIZE THE WEBSITE THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN THE GITHUB LINK PROVIDED BELOW. THE SAME IS TO BE ACHIEVED BY FORKING THE REPOSITORY ON YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT.
GITHUB URL: HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/SAMEER-8080/WEBSITE-PRT-ORG

A JENKINSFILE HAS TO BE CREATED THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FORKED REPOSITORY AS WELL WHICH WILL ALSO CONTAIN THE MANIFEST FILES REQUIRED. MORE INFORMATION ON THE MANIFEST FILES REQUIRED IS MENTIONED IN THE NEXT POINT. THE JENKINSFILE SHOULD BUILD A NEW IMAGE UPON CHANGES TO THE REPOSITORY TO ENSURE THAT THE LATEST WEBSITE IS DISPLAYED AT ALL TIMES.
NOTE: FREESTYLE JOBS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR THIS PRT, A PIPELINE JOB HAS TO BE CREATED AND CREATION OF FREESTYLE JOBS INSTEAD WILL HEAVILY IMPACT THE MARKING NEGATIVELY.

THE MANIFEST FILE REQUIRED ARE:
A DEPLOYMENT FILE THAT WILL CREATE THE REQUIRED DEPLOYMENT FROM THE IMAGE WHICH WILL BE CREATED FROM THE DOCKERFILE AND UPLOADED TO DOCKERHUB. THE DEPLOYMENT WILL HAVE A TOTAL OF 5 REPLICAS.
A SERVICE FILE WHICH WILL BE OF TYPE NODEPORT WHICH WILL EXPOSE THE ABOVE MENTIONED DEPLOYMENT ON PORT 30010.
THE JENKINS PIPELINE WHICH WILL BE CREATED SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERED ONCE CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE FORKED REPOSITORY.
